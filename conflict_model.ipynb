    "\n",
    "This code uses **NetworkX** to model a network of countries’ capital cities. Each city is a node in the graph and has attributes like geographic position, whether it’s “blocked” by conflict, and a resource dictionary (e.g., containing “food”). Edges between cities represent possible trade routes, determined by physical distance. We run a simple simulation in discrete time steps, where cities:\n",
    "1. Produce a fixed amount of food if they are not blocked.  \n",
    "2. Trade surplus food with neighboring cities that have a deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a city is “blocked,” it neither produces nor trades its resources. After running the simulation for a few turns, we visually plot the network on a world map."

    "Each node corresponds to a capital city. Attributes include:\n",
    "- **pos**: `(longitude, latitude)`, used for distance calculations and plotting.\n",
    "- **country**: The country name (e.g., \"France\").\n",
    "- **blocked**: A boolean indicating if the city is blocked due to conflict.\n",
    "- **resources**: A dictionary that holds resource quantities. Currently, only \"food\" is tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edges\n",
    "Edges represent potential trade routes between cities. An edge is created only if two cities are within a specified `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` (3,000 km in this example). Each edge has:\n",
    "- **distance**: The great-circle distance between the two cities in kilometers.\n",
    "- **capacity**: A sample \"capacity\" attribute. This can be used to model throughput limits (e.g., how much a route can carry per time step).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocked Nodes\n",
    "When a node is **blocked**:\n",
    "- It does not produce food (or other resources).\n",
    "- It does not send or receive any resources via trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulates, for instance, a siege or an interruption in supply lines due to conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Flow\n",
    "1. **Production**: Each unblocked node produces a certain amount of \"food.\"  \n",
    "2. **Trade**: Surplus food is shared with neighbors that have a deficit, capped by certain limits.  \n",
    "3. **Conflict**: If a node is set to `blocked=True`, it is omitted from production and trade."

    "\n",
    "### Add New Resources\n",
    "- Extend the `resources` dictionary to track multiple resources (e.g., `\"oil\"`, `\"gold\"`, etc.).\n",
    "- Modify the `produce_food` function or create additional functions (e.g., `produce_oil`) to handle the production of different resources.\n",
    "- Update the `trade_food` function to handle multiple resources, possibly with separate thresholds and trade caps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refine Production and Trade Logic\n",
    "- Make production dependent on city-specific factors (population, technology level, random events, etc.).\n",
